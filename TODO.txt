Phase I - Requirements Analysis & Prototyping 
====

Best Practices
===

* Leverage Social Media API's where feasible 

* Utilize JSON as default data type to pull data from Social media provider API's 



Functional Prototypes
====

* Pastebin: working prototype -
rewrite of scraper adding Python multiprocessor functionality to distribute work load across multiple CPU's 

* Twitter: working prototype -
Add Python Multiprocessor functionality to distribute work load across multiple CPU's 


Non Functional TODO
===

* re-write of Pastbin implementation to 100% leverage the Pastebin API - JSON

* reddit - utlize the Reddit API - https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API - JSON

* facebook - will be tricky - they are a closed environment -
Facebook Graph API does utilize JSON - only use at this time may be sentiment trending topics related to CND operations 
  http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/

* DarkNet & TorWeb - Web Crawler - TorWeb may not be so difficult -
send a web crawler throug tor proxy and scrape all content for watchlist based strings of strategic value -
correlate back to the TorWeb URL. DarkNet P2P sites will be even trickier -
may require active operations to penetrate speheres of
trust to gain multi tiered authentication needed to gain access
to the darker areas of the Internet for proactive CND operations. 

* Spiders/Crawlers to data mine the public P2P networks -
searching for drops from Active CNA/CNE Operations - proactively hunting the hunters 

* Natural Language Processing -
exploring feasibility of leveraging Google Translate API to data mine foreign Social Media Sites -
integration with Baidu API. Target Chinese and Russian Social Media sites via their API's -
leverage Google Translate API to translate the JSON based dumps -
monitor in real time for any activity proactively toward a more effective CND strategy. 

* Hadoop and Hadoop EcoSystem -
explore creation of AI/NLP/ML programming logic to be leveraged by Hadoop and Mahout and Solr.
Utilize HBase Hadoop database to enrich and add attributes to data -
incorporate Hive, and utilize Zookeeper for jobtracking.
Functionality of this are of the software architecture will be to conduct advance AI/NLP/ML CND Analytics
